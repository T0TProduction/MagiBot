This bot only works as intended on a single server. 
It will most likely not crash, but just assume everyones on the same server and handle reports etc. respective to that
If you want a bot that runs once and connects to multiple servers you will have to look elsewhere or wait until i implement that 
(this has super low priority, since we only use it on one server)
The biggest challenge in code will be the Database, as everything else wont change
